# DP_BasicReact
Basic React app to understand and implement the concept of components, props, routing, useState and useEffect and its types etc.

## Installing / Getting started
A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app running.

```
npx create vite@latest
```
This create the app. After that you need to write the project & package name (you can even skip this part).
Then choose the required framework using which you intend to build this app (In this case, I have choosen React).
Then choose the desired variant (Here you have 4 options: TypeScript, TypeScript with compiler, JavaScript & JavaScript with compiler). Here, I choosed JavaScript

Then run the following commands:
```
cd "folder_name"
```

```
npm install
```
**OR**
```
npm i
```
This code install the necessary packages required to build the project
```
npm run dev
```
It starts the development server. On following the link provided, you get to see the sample app.
If you ever intend to change the command for runnig the code, you can do that by making some changes in the package.json file.
